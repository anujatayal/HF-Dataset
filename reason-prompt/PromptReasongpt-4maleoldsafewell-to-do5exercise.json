Premise: Studies have shown that socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access can impact heart failure management in African-American patients. Given your status as a well-to-do African-American patient, your access to resources for heart failure management may be better than others in your demographic, but this does not negate the potential for other barriers or challenges.

Reasoning: Given your age, we need to consider that the type and intensity of exercise suitable for you may differ from that of younger patients. As a male, you may also have different physical capacities and needs compared to female patients. Living in a safe neighborhood provides you with an opportunity to engage in outdoor activities. Meanwhile, your well-to-do socio-economic condition suggests that you have resources for home exercise equipment or gym memberships, which can further facilitate regular physical activity.

Solution: I'd recommend a combination of moderate aerobic exercise, like brisk walking or cycling, and light strength training, tailored to your physical capacity. Outdoor exercises can be done in your safe neighborhood, while indoor exercises can be facilitated by your financial resources.

Anticipate Barrier: Given your age, you may have concerns about the intensity of the exercises or may experience physical discomfort during the exercises. 

Solve Barrier: To overcome this, we can start with low-intensity exercises and gradually increase the intensity as your body adapts. It's also important to work with a physical therapist or a fitness trainer who understands your specific needs and can tailor an exercise program accordingly.

Educate: Regular exercise is crucial for managing heart failure as it strengthens the heart and improves circulation, reducing the risk of heart disease complications. Always remember, the key is not to overdo it, but to maintain a consistent routine that is suitable for your age and physical condition. It's not about how strenuous the exercise is, but about how regular and consistent you are with it.
