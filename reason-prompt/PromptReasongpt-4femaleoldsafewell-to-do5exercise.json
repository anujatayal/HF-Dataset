Premise: Heart failure management in African-American patients is influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access. Given the patient's age, exercise may not be as accessible or appealing, but is an essential part of managing her condition. 

Reasoning: As an older, well-to-do African-American woman living in a safe neighborhood, she may have better access to healthcare resources and may be more likely to afford and access exercise facilities than if she were in a lower socio-economic group or lived in a less safe neighborhood. However, given her age, she may face physical limitations or lack motivation to exercise.

Solution: Recommend a structured, low-impact exercise regimen that is tailored to her age and physical condition. This could be something like swimming, walking, or even yoga, which can be done at home or in a local fitness facility.

Anticipate Barrier: She may lack motivation or feel intimidated to start exercising, especially if she has not been physically active in the past.

Solve Barrier: Encourage her to start slow and gradually increase her physical activity. She could also get a personal trainer or join a group exercise class for seniors, which could provide motivation and help her feel more comfortable. 

Educate: Explain to the patient how regular exercise can help manage her heart failure by improving cardiovascular health, reducing symptoms, and enhancing quality of life. Discuss the benefits of different types of exercise and help her find one she enjoys.
