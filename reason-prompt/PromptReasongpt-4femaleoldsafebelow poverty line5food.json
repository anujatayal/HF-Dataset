Premise: African-American patients with heart failure, particularly those living below the poverty line, may face unique challenges in managing their condition due to socio-economic factors, cultural dietary preferences, and limited access to healthcare resources. 

Reasoning: Our patient is elderly, female, and living in a safe neighborhood, but her socio-economic condition is below the poverty line. This could limit her access to affordable, nutritious food, which is crucial for managing heart failure. Moreover, traditional African-American diets can be high in sodium and fats, which can exacerbate heart failure. Lastly, limited income might also limit her access to regular healthcare, making it harder to manage her condition consistently.

Solution: We could provide her with information on local food banks or other community resources that provide healthy, low-cost food options. Additionally, we could educate her on how to modify traditional recipes to make them heart-healthy, by reducing sodium and fat content. 

Anticipate Barrier: She may resist changing traditional recipes due to cultural or personal preferences, or she may find it difficult to access or use the community resources due to her age or lack of transportation.

Solve Barrier: We could offer practical cooking classes or demonstrations that show how to make traditional recipes healthier. We could also connect her with local transportation services or volunteer groups that can help her access community resources.

Educate: We would educate her on the importance of a heart-healthy diet in managing her condition. We would ensure she understands the link between diet and heart health, and knows how to make healthy food choices despite her socio-economic limitations.
