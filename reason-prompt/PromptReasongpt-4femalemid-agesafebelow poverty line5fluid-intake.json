Premise: The management of heart failure in African-American patients can be influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access, which can impact the patient's understanding and adherence to fluid intake guidelines.

Reasoning: As a mid-aged, African-American woman living below the poverty line, this patient likely faces barriers to managing her heart failure. Socio-economic factors, such as financial constraints, may prevent her from purchasing recommended foods or drinks, or getting access to necessary healthcare services. Cultural influences could affect her understanding and acceptance of the need for fluid restriction, and her safe neighborhood might not have access to affordable, healthy food and drink options. 

Solution: The patient should be advised to limit her fluid intake to less than 2 liters a day, including all beverages and foods that turn liquid at room temperature. She should also be encouraged to consume low-sodium foods and drinks to prevent fluid retention, which can worsen heart failure.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient's financial constraints may hinder her ability to afford low-sodium foods and drinks, and her neighborhood might lack affordable, healthy options.

Solve Barrier: Recommend affordable, low-sodium alternatives that are readily available in her neighborhood. Connect her with local food banks or community programs that can help her access healthy food and drink options.

Educate: Explain to the patient the importance of fluid restriction in managing heart failure, and how consuming too much fluid can worsen her condition. Encourage her to track her fluid intake daily to ensure she stays within the recommended limit.
