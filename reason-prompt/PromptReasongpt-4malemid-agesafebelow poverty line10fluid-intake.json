Premise: African-American heart failure patients, especially those in lower socio-economic strata, frequently face challenges in disease management due to a combination of socio-cultural determinants, limited healthcare access, and dietary habits, which often include high-sodium diets leading to fluid retention.

Reasoning: Given the patient's socio-economic condition, it is possible that he has limited access to healthcare resources and healthy food options. This, combined with any potential cultural dietary preferences, may lead to a high-sodium diet that can exacerbate heart failure by causing fluid retention. Additionally, the patient's age and gender put him at higher risk for heart failure, and thus, more stringent fluid management is critical.

Solution: Recommend a low-sodium diet and daily fluid restriction (typically around 2 liters/day), as these are proven strategies for minimizing fluid retention in heart failure patients. Encourage the patient to read food labels for sodium content, choose fresh fruits and vegetables over canned or processed foods, and avoid adding extra salt to meals.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may face barriers in implementing these dietary changes due to limited financial resources, lack of access to fresh produce, or ingrained dietary habits.

Solve Barrier: Connect the patient with local resources such as food banks or community programs that offer fresh fruits and vegetables at reduced cost. Provide education on cost-effective ways of implementing a low-sodium diet, such as using herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt. If necessary, assist with arranging transportation to these resources.

Educate: Explain to the patient that fluid restriction and low-sodium diet are crucial for managing his heart failure. Teach him how to read food labels for sodium content, demonstrate how to measure daily fluid intake, and provide easy-to-follow, low-sodium recipes. Reinforce that small, consistent changes can have a big impact on his heart health.
