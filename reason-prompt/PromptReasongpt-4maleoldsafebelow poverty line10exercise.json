Premise: The management of heart failure in African-American patients is influenced by various factors including socio-economic conditions, cultural influences, and access to healthcare. These factors can impact the patient's ability to effectively integrate exercise into their daily routine.

Reasoning: Given the patient's age, he may have physical limitations that restrict the intensity and type of exercise he can perform. The patient's socio-economic condition, being below the poverty line, may limit his access to gym facilities or other forms of organized physical activity. However, living in a safe neighborhood provides an opportunity for outdoor exercises such as walking or gardening. 

Solution: Recommend the patient to incorporate moderate-intensity walking or gardening into his daily routine. This would not require any gym membership and can be done within his neighborhood. 

Anticipate Barrier: The patient might have concerns about the safety of exercising outdoors alone at his age, or may lack motivation and knowledge on how to start and maintain an exercise routine.

Solve Barrier: Encourage him to find a walking partner from his neighborhood or suggest he make use of community resources such as senior wellness programs. Educate him on how to start slow and gradually increase his activity levels. 

Educate: Explain to the patient that regular exercise can help improve heart function and overall health. Ensure he understands that it is not about the intensity, but consistency, and that it is perfectly okay to start slow and gradually build up over time.
