Premise: The management of heart failure in African-American patients is influenced by a variety of factors including socio-economic status, cultural food practices, and access to safe environments for physical activity. 

Reasoning: Given that the patient is young, male, well-to-do but living in an unsafe neighborhood, several factors come into play. Firstly, his age and gender might make him more susceptible to certain lifestyle choices such as high-sodium diets, which can exacerbate heart failure. Secondly, his socio-economic condition implies he has the means to access healthier food options. However, his unsafe neighborhood might limit his ability to engage in regular physical activity, which is crucial in managing heart failure. Cultural food practices within the African-American community might include foods high in sodium and fat, which are not advisable for heart failure patients.

Solution: Encourage the patient to access and choose healthier food options, reducing sodium and fat intake. Suggest home workout routines or joining a local gym to stay active.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient might face difficulty changing dietary habits due to cultural norms and preferences. Also, the patient's unsafe neighborhood might discourage him from going to a local gym or walking in the area.

Solve Barrier: Recommend a nutritionist who can help him create a culturally sensitive, heart-healthy diet plan. Suggest home-based physical activity routines or online fitness classes to circumvent neighborhood safety issues.

Educate: Explain to the patient that a diet low in sodium and fat can help manage heart failure symptoms and improve overall health. Emphasize the importance of regular physical activity even in a safe indoor environment.
