Premise: Socio-economic condition, cultural dietary practices, and limited access to healthcare are factors that can significantly impact heart failure management in African-American patients, especially those living below the poverty line. 

Reasoning: Most African-American diets are rich in sodium and fats, which can exacerbate heart failure symptoms. The patient's age and gender also play a role in how the body responds to diet and heart failure treatment. For older women, especially those living in safe but low-income neighborhoods, access to nutritious, heart-healthy foods may be limited, which further complicates dietary management of heart failure. 

Solution: The patient should be guided to adopt a low-sodium, low-fat diet, which includes more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy products. If possible, she should be encouraged to cook at home and avoid processed foods, which are typically high in sodium and unhealthy fats.

Anticipate Barrier: Given her socio-economic condition, she may have limited access to fresh and affordable heart-healthy foods, and she may resort to cheaper, processed alternatives.

Solve Barrier: The patient can be referred to local food assistance programs or community gardens which can provide access to fresh produce. Cooking classes or resources that teach how to prepare heart-healthy meals on a budget could also be beneficial.

Educate: Explain to the patient the importance of a heart-healthy diet in managing her heart failure symptoms and overall health. Discuss the negative impact of high sodium and fat intake on her heart health and suggest affordable substitutes. Provide her with written materials or resources for further information and support.
