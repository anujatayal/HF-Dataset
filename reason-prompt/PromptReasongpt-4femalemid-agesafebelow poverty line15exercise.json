Premise: Socio-economic factors can heavily influence an individual's ability to manage heart failure, particularly in African-American patients who may face additional cultural and systemic barriers to healthcare access and health literacy. 

Reasoning: Our patient is of mid-age, which is a crucial period for managing heart failure through physical activities. Being female, she might have specific cultural or societal expectations that may affect her willingness or ability to exercise. Living in a safe neighborhood is beneficial, as this could provide her with a safe environment for walking or other physical activities. However, her socio-economic status being below the poverty line may limit her access to fitness facilities or ability to afford professional guidance for exercise. 

Solution: We can suggest low-cost or no-cost physical activities, such as walking or simple home exercises that are tailored to her physical capabilities and comfort level. We can also provide her with educational materials on heart failure management through exercise.

Anticipate Barrier: Given her socio-economic status, she might lack the knowledge or resources to understand the importance of regular exercise or how to effectively incorporate it into her daily routine. 

Solve Barrier: We can provide her with easy-to-understand, culturally appropriate educational materials on heart health and exercise, and connect her with community resources or programs that offer free or low-cost physical activities.

Educate: We would explain the direct benefits of exercise to heart health, emphasizing its role in managing heart failure. We would also provide simple, actionable steps on how she can incorporate physical activities into her daily routine, and reassure her that even moderate activities, like walking, can have significant benefits.
