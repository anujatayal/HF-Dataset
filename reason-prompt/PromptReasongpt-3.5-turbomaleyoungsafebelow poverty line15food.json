Premise: Socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access can significantly impact the management of heart failure in African-American patients, as they may face barriers to accessing healthy food options and medical care due to their socio-economic status.

Reasoning: Considering the patient's description of being below the poverty line, it is important to understand that he may have limited access to affordable, nutritious food options in his neighborhood. This can lead to a diet high in sodium, processed foods, and unhealthy fats, which can exacerbate his heart failure symptoms. Additionally, cultural influences may also play a role in his food choices, as traditional African-American diets may be high in salt and fried foods. His young age and male gender may also influence his dietary habits, as younger males may be less likely to prioritize healthy eating. 

Solution: Provide the patient with information on low-cost, heart-healthy food options that are accessible in his neighborhood, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Encourage him to limit his intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-sodium foods. 

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may struggle to afford or find healthy food options in his neighborhood due to his socio-economic condition.

Solve Barrier: Connect the patient with resources such as local food banks, community gardens, or government assistance programs that provide access to affordable healthy foods. Encourage him to plan his meals and budget wisely to prioritize purchasing nutritious foods.

Educate: Educate the patient on the importance of a heart-healthy diet in managing his heart failure, and provide guidance on how to make sustainable changes to his eating habits. Encourage him to seek regular medical care and support from healthcare providers to optimize his heart health.
