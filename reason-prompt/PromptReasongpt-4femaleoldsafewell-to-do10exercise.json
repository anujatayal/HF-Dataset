Premise: Heart failure management in African-American patients is influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access. The exercise regimen suggested must be suitable for the patient's age, gender, and socio-economic condition. 

Reasoning: Given that the patient is well-to-do, she likely has access to a variety of exercise options that might not be available to those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. As an older African-American woman, she may have cultural or personal preferences for certain types of exercise. Additionally, her safe neighborhood provides a conducive environment for outdoor activities such as walking or jogging. However, her age may limit the intensity of exercises she can safely perform.

Solution: Considering her resources and environment, I suggest a mix of low-impact exercises like swimming, yoga, and brisk walking. These exercises are safe for her age and can be done in her neighborhood or a local gym.

Anticipated Barrier: The patient may be concerned about her ability to perform these exercises due to her age or the progression of her heart failure.

Solve Barrier: To mitigate these fears, we can introduce a personal trainer or physical therapist into her routine who is experienced in working with older adults and individuals with heart conditions. They can ensure that exercises are performed safely and at an appropriate intensity level.

Educate: I would educate the patient about the importance of regular exercise in managing heart failure, providing her with resources on how to safely start an exercise routine and the benefits she can expect to see. I would also emphasize the role of the physical therapist or trainer in ensuring safety during exercise.
