Premise: African-American men are more likely to suffer from heart failure compared to other racial groups. This can be influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural eating habits, and access to healthcare. It's crucial for these patients to manage their diet to mitigate their heart failure symptoms and improve overall health.

Reasoning: Given that the patient is a middle-aged African-American man living below the poverty line, there are a few factors to consider. His socio-economic status may limit his access to fresh, unprocessed foods which are better for heart health. Additionally, cultural influences may encourage the consumption of foods high in sodium, fats, and cholesterol, which could exacerbate heart failure. Also, his neighborhood, while safe, might lack resources like affordable grocery stores or health food outlets.

Solution: The patient should try to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into his diet. He should also try to reduce his intake of high-sodium and high-fat foods.

Anticipate Barrier: Financial constraints may pose a challenge in affording healthier food options. 

Solve Barrier: Explore resources such as food banks, community gardens, and federal programs like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) which can assist in obtaining affordable, healthy food. Cooking at home can also be a cost-effective way of controlling what goes into meals.

Educate: Explain the connection between diet and heart health, and how making dietary changes can help manage heart failure symptoms. Provide easy-to-understand resources on heart-healthy diet guidelines, along with a list of affordable, heart-healthy foods. Support this with cooking tips and simple recipes to encourage home cooking.
