Premise: Heart failure management in African-American patients is influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and access to healthcare. Living below the poverty line can limit access to nutritious food which is essential in managing heart failure. The patient's young age may also impact his understanding of the seriousness of his condition and the importance of a healthy diet. 

Reasoning: The young African-American male patient is from a safe neighborhood but is living below the poverty line, which might limit his access to nutritious foods. He might be more inclined to eat cheaper, processed foods that are high in salt and unhealthy fats, which are detrimental to heart health. Furthermore, cultural influences might also play a role in his food choices, as certain traditional foods might be high in unhealthy components. His young age might also make him more susceptible to unhealthy food choices due to lack of awareness about the significance of a balanced diet in managing heart failure.

Solution: The patient should be advised to consume heart-healthy foods, like fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. He should also limit his salt and unhealthy fat intake. 

Anticipate Barrier: The main barrier would be the patient's limited financial resources, which might make it difficult for him to afford healthy foods. 

Solve Barrier: To overcome this barrier, the patient can be directed towards community resources that provide affordable or free healthy foods, such as food banks, farmers' markets that accept SNAP benefits, and community gardens. He could also be taught how to prepare healthy meals on a budget.

Educate: The patient should be educated about the importance of a heart-healthy diet in managing his condition. He should be made aware of the potential risks of a poor diet and the benefits of a nutritious one. Through education, he can gain the knowledge and skills needed to make healthier food choices despite his socio-economic challenges.
