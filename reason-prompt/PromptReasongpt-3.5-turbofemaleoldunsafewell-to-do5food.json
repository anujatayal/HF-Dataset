Premise: Socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access can significantly impact heart failure management in African-American patients. 
Reasoning: Considering the patient is well-to-do, access to healthy food options may not be a barrier. However, living in an unsafe neighborhood could limit the availability of fresh produce and healthy food choices. Additionally, cultural influences may play a role in dietary preferences and choices. 
Solution: Encourage the patient to focus on a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Suggest meal planning and grocery delivery services to overcome the challenges of accessing healthy food in her neighborhood. 
Anticipate Barrier: The patient may face resistance or difficulty in changing dietary habits due to cultural influences or personal preferences. 
Solve Barrier: Offer culturally appropriate recipes and meal ideas that align with heart-healthy guidelines. Provide resources and support to help the patient make sustainable changes to her diet. 
Educate: Educate the patient on the importance of nutrition in managing heart failure and how making dietary changes can improve her overall health and well-being. Encourage open communication and ongoing support in her journey towards better heart health.
