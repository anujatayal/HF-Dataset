Premise: Lower socio-economic conditions, cultural influences, and limited healthcare access can negatively impact African-American heart failure patients' management, including fluid intake considerations. 

Reasoning: This young female patient living below the poverty line may face challenges in managing her heart failure due to potential financial constraints. Limited access to nutritional food and clean water can affect her dietary habits and fluid intake. Furthermore, cultural influences may promote the consumption of high-sodium foods, which can lead to fluid retention and exacerbate heart failure symptoms. Lastly, her access to healthcare services might be limited due to her socio-economic status, making regular check-ups and medication less accessible. 

Solution: She should aim to consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins while limiting sodium intake. Fluid intake should be carefully monitored and should not exceed a set limit advised by her healthcare provider. 

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may struggle to afford healthier food options or lack knowledge about nutrition and managing her condition. 

Solve Barrier: Refer the patient to local community resources, such as food banks, that provide healthier food options. Also, providing educational materials regarding nutrition and heart failure management can help her make informed decisions about her diet and fluid intake. 

Educate: Explain the importance of limiting fluid and sodium intake in managing heart failure. Encourage her to seek regular healthcare consultations to monitor her condition effectively.
