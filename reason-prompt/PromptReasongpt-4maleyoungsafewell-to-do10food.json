Premise: The management of heart failure, especially dietary management, in African-American patients is significantly influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and access to healthcare. 

Reasoning: In the given patient's scenario, being young and male, he may need to consider heart-healthy food options that are age-appropriate and gender-specific. Coming from a well-to-do socio-economic condition, he likely has access to a wide variety of foods, including healthier choices. However, cultural influences like traditional African-American cuisine, which can be high in sodium, fats, and cholesterol, might impact his dietary choices. Moreover, his living in a safe neighborhood could mean better access to healthcare services and resources for managing heart failure.

Solution: His diet should include low-sodium, low-cholesterol foods with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. He should also limit the intake of processed foods, which are often high in sodium and unhealthy fats. 

Anticipate Barrier: The main barrier could be his preference for traditional African-American cuisine, which might make it challenging for him to adhere to a heart-healthy diet.

Solve Barrier: Encourage him to modify traditional recipes using healthier alternatives like using herbs and spices instead of salt for flavoring, using lean meats, and increasing the number of vegetables in dishes. 

Educate: Educate him about the importance of maintaining a heart-healthy diet in managing heart failure. Explain the effect of sodium, cholesterol, and unhealthy fats on heart health and how the recommended diet can help manage his condition effectively. Also, emphasize the importance of regular check-ups and staying in touch with healthcare providers to track his progress.
