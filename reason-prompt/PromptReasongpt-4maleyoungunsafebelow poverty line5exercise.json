Premise: The socio-economic conditions, the safety of the neighborhood, and cultural tendencies significantly affect the health outcomes of African-American heart failure patients, especially those living below the poverty line in unsafe neighborhoods.

Reasoning: The patient's young age and gender could make him more susceptible to risky behaviors such as smoking, alcohol abuse, and unhealthy eating, which are prevalent in unsafe neighborhoods. These behaviors can exacerbate heart failure. Moreover, being below the poverty line may limit his access to healthcare services and nutritious foods, both of which are essential for managing heart failure. Lack of safe spaces for exercise in the neighborhood may also deter physical activity, further worsening his condition. 

Solution: Encourage the patient to engage in indoor exercises like jumping jacks, stair climbing, or using an exercise video. If possible, recommend him to join a local community center that offers exercise programs. Also, advise him about the importance of a balanced diet and abstaining from risky behaviors.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may lack the resources to join a community center or buy exercise equipment. He may also find it hard to change his dietary habits due to financial constraints or cultural influences.

Solve Barrier: Connect him with local organizations or charities that provide free or discounted gym memberships. Suggest inexpensive, heart-healthy foods and provide tips on how to prepare them. If necessary, refer him to a dietician who can help him devise a suitable dietary plan considering his cultural preferences.

Educate: Explain to him the importance of regular exercise and a balanced diet in managing heart failure. Make him understand that regardless of his situation, there are ways to stay active and eat healthily. Highlight the detrimental effects of risky behaviors on his condition and stress the importance of medical follow-up.
