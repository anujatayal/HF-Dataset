Premise: African-American patients, particularly those with low socio-economic status, often face disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. Additionally, cultural influences may affect food choices, which contribute to heart failure management. 

Reasoning: As a young, African-American, female patient living under the poverty line in a safe neighborhood, the patient likely faces numerous challenges in managing her heart failure. Cultural food preferences may include high-sodium and high-fat foods, which can exacerbate heart failure. Limited resources might restrict her access to healthier food options or specialty care. However, her young age and female gender may mean she is more open to lifestyle changes and could respond well to heart failure management strategies. 

Solution: Encourage the patient to incorporate more fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins into her diet. Suggest low-cost options like frozen vegetables, canned fruits in natural juice, and bulk dry beans. Direct her to local resources such as food pantries or subsidized grocery programs for low-income individuals. 

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may find it difficult to afford or access these healthier food options given her socio-economic status.

Solve Barrier: Connect her with local food banks or community programs that provide healthy food options at a lower cost. Also, teach her how to prepare healthy meals on a budget, using lower-cost ingredients.

Educate: Explain to the patient how a healthy diet can significantly impact her heart health, and how certain foods, especially those high in sodium and fat, can exacerbate heart failure. Help her understand that despite her economic challenges, there are resources and strategies available to help her manage her condition effectively.
