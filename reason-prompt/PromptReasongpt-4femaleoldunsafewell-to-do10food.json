Premise: Dietary habits, influenced by socio-economic status, cultural practices, and neighborhood safety, may significantly affect heart failure management in elderly African-American women. 

Reasoning: In this case, our patient resides in an unsafe neighborhood, which might limit her ability to access fresh fruits, vegetables, and other heart-healthy foods. Yet, her well-to-do status may enable her to afford healthier food options, even if they're not readily available in her neighborhood. Furthermore, cultural food practices common in the African-American community, such as high-sodium soul food, could also be contributing to her heart failure.

Solution: Recommending a heart-healthy diet is paramount. This includes foods low in sodium and saturated fats, and rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy. She should also limit processed and fried foods.

Anticipate Barrier: The main barriers could be limited access to heart-healthy foods due to her unsafe neighborhood, and resistance to changing traditional food habits.

Solve Barrier: To overcome these barriers, she could consider online grocery shopping or a grocery delivery service. Local community centers or churches may also offer food delivery services for the elderly. As for changing dietary habits, incorporating healthier alternatives in traditional recipes can be a good start.

Educate: Educate the patient about the importance of a heart-healthy diet in managing heart failure, and provide ideas for modifying traditional recipes with healthier alternatives. Offer resources for online grocery shopping or local grocery delivery services to ensure she has access to nutritious foods.
