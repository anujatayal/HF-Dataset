Premise: The management of heart failure in African-American patients is influenced by a complex interplay of socio-economic factors, cultural dietary practices, and access to quality healthcare. 

Reasoning: The patient is well-to-do and thus likely has access to a variety of food options and quality healthcare. However, living in an unsafe neighborhood may limit his ability to freely shop for healthy food options or engage in regular physical activity. His age and gender also put him at a higher risk for heart failure. African-American culture often incorporates foods high in sodium and fats, which can exacerbate heart failure.

Solution: Encourage the patient to incorporate heart-healthy foods into his diet, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. He should also try to limit his intake of processed foods, which are often high in sodium and unhealthy fats.

Anticipate Barrier: He may face challenges in accessing fresh, healthy foods due to his neighborhood conditions. He may also have difficulty changing dietary habits due to cultural or personal preferences.

Solve Barrier: Recommend online grocery delivery services or local community programs that deliver fresh produce, which can help him to access healthy foods. Provide him with heart-healthy recipes that incorporate familiar flavors and foods from African-American cuisine to help ease the transition to a healthier diet.

Educate: Explain to the patient how a healthy diet can help manage heart failure, reduce symptoms, and improve overall health. Discuss the importance of portion control, reading food labels for sodium content, and balancing meals with a mix of lean protein, whole grains, and fresh fruits and vegetables.
