Premise: Heart failure management in African-American patients is influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access. This patient's well-to-do socio-economic status and unsafe neighborhood may impact her food choices, which are crucial in heart failure management.

Reasoning: Being well-to-do, the patient likely has access to a variety of food options. However, living in an unsafe neighborhood might limit her access to fresh produce or healthy food outlets, increasing her reliance on unhealthy, processed foods. African-American culture traditionally includes a high-sodium diet, and this combined with limited access to healthy options can exacerbate heart failure symptoms. 

Solution: Encourage the patient to choose healthier food options, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meat, and whole grains, while cutting down on processed foods that contain high levels of sodium and unhealthy fats. 

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may have difficulty accessing fresh produce or healthy food outlets due to her unsafe neighborhood, and may not have exposure to heart-friendly recipes that align with her cultural preferences.

Solve Barrier: Recommend online grocery delivery services that provide fresh produce, and provide her with heart-friendly recipes that align with her cultural food preferences. Also, suggest meal planning and preparation to reduce reliance on unhealthy, processed foods.

Educate: Educate the patient on the importance of diet in managing heart failure and the risks associated with a high-sodium diet. Provide guidance on reading food labels to help her make healthier choices.
