Premise: The management of heart failure is highly influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and access to healthcare. These factors are particularly relevant for African-American patients who are statistically at higher risk for heart failure and suffer from higher mortality rates. 

Reasoning: Given the patient's age, it is crucial to educate him about the importance of a healthy diet, as it can significantly help manage his heart failure and reduce the risk of further complications. The patient's socio-economic condition implies that he might not have access to high-quality, nutritious food, and may rely on cheaper, less healthy options. His cultural background might also influence his food choices. Additionally, being in a safe neighborhood suggests that he might have access to local resources for healthy food or community programs.

Solution: Encourage the patient to consume a low-sodium, heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Also, suggest utilizing local resources like farmer's markets, food banks, or community gardens for affordable, fresh produce.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may lack the funds to purchase healthier food options, or he may struggle to shift away from culturally influenced food preferences that are less healthy.

Solve Barrier: Recommend affordable, heart-healthy alternatives to expensive food items. Connect him with local resources that provide nutritious food at lower costs. Encourage cultural adaptation of his diet by incorporating healthier versions of traditional foods.

Educate: Explain to the patient how a healthy diet can positively affect his heart health and overall well-being. Discuss the benefits of reducing sodium intake, increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, and the importance of regular exercise. Also, educate him about the importance of regular check-ups to monitor his heart condition.
