Premise: Socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access significantly impact the management of heart failure in African-American patients. This is particularly true when patients do not have access to safe, clean water or are unable to afford fresh, low-sodium food alternatives. 

Reasoning: The patient's description indicates that she might be living in a neighborhood where access to clean water may be compromised, making it risky to consume large quantities of fluid. Additionally, her socio-economic condition suggests she may not be able to afford healthier food options, leading to a higher intake of sodium which can exacerbate fluid retention in heart failure patients. Furthermore, being a mid-aged female, hormonal changes could also contribute to fluid retention.

Solution: The patient should limit fluid intake to approximately 2 liters per day, including liquids in foods. The patient should also aim to reduce sodium intake, avoiding processed foods, and opt for fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins when possible.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may face difficulty in accessing clean water and affording fresh, low-sodium foods due to her socio-economic condition and neighborhood.

Solve Barrier: Community resources should be explored to provide the patient with access to clean water and affordable, nutritious food options. This could include local food banks, community water purification programs, or government assistance programs.

Educate: Explain to the patient the importance of limiting fluid and sodium intake in managing heart failure. Make her aware of the potential consequences of not managing these aspects of her diet. Also, inform her about the local resources available to assist her in adhering to these dietary restrictions.
