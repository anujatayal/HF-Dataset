Premise: Heart failure management in African-American patients, especially in older adults, can be significantly impacted by various socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access. Exercise, as a part of heart failure management, can be affected by these elements as well.

Reasoning: Given the patient's age, it's important to consider that his physical capability for exercise is likely to be less than that of a younger individual. Being male, he is statistically at a higher risk of heart failure. His neighborhood's safety can affect his ability to engage in outdoor physical activities. Additionally, his socio-economic condition implies he might have better access to healthcare and fitness resources. 

Solution: It would be beneficial for the patient to engage in regular, moderate-intensity physical activity tailored to his age and physical condition. This could include activities like indoor cycling or yoga, which can be conducted safely at home.

Anticipate Barrier: A potential barrier might be his reluctance or fear of exercising due to his heart condition and the safety of his neighborhood.

Solve Barrier: Encourage him to consider home-based exercises or joining a local fitness center for a controlled and secure environment. He could also be referred to a physical therapist who can design a suitable exercise plan, considering his heart condition.

Educate: Inform the patient about the importance of exercise in managing his heart condition, how it helps in strengthening his heart muscle, improving circulation, and maintaining a healthy weight. Ensure he understands that with proper guidance and precautions, exercise is not only safe but beneficial for his heart health.
