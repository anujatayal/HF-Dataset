Premise: Heart failure management in African-American patients, especially those living below the poverty line, can be influenced by socio-economic factors, cultural practices, and access to healthcare.

Reasoning: Given the patient's young age and gender, he may be at a higher risk for heart failure due to socio-economic stressors and potential lifestyle choices. His socio-economic condition might limit his access to healthcare resources, such as regular check-ups and medication, making it essential to manage his heart failure effectively at home. Cultural practices and food preferences might affect his dietary habits, including fluid-intake, which directly impacts heart failure management.

Solution: The patient should limit fluid intake to no more than 2 liters per day, which includes all forms of fluids like water, juice, soup, etc. This amount can prevent fluid overload, a common issue in heart failure patients which can worsen the condition.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient might struggle to measure and limit fluid intake due to lack of resources. He may also find it hard to change dietary habits due to cultural preferences or budget constraints.

Solve Barrier: Use common household items to measure fluid intake, like a water bottle or measuring cup. Encourage the patient to prioritize affordable heart-healthy foods and fluids over less healthy options. Provide him with a list of budget-friendly, heart-healthy food suggestions.

Educate: Explain to the patient the importance of fluid restriction in managing heart failure. Describe how excessive fluid intake can strain the heart, exacerbating heart failure symptoms, and complicate the disease. Stress on the importance of regular monitoring and follow-ups, if accessible, for his condition.
