Premise: Socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access significantly impact heart failure management in African-American patients. Dietary habits, shaped by cultural influences and economic conditions, directly affect heart health. Lack of healthcare access in unsafe neighborhoods and financial limitations can further exacerbate these issues.

Reasoning: The patient's age and gender indicate a higher risk for heart disease due to hormonal changes post-menopause. Living in an unsafe neighborhood, she might have limited access to fresh, healthy foods and safe places to exercise, leading to a diet high in sodium and fats, common in economically disadvantaged populations. Additionally, cultural preferences might influence her to consume traditional foods that may be unhealthy for heart failure.

Solution: A balanced diet low in sodium, saturated and trans fats, and cholesterol, but high in fiber, whole grains, and lean proteins is advisable. Include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean proteins in her diet. Encourage the preparation of traditional foods using healthier ingredients and cooking methods.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient might face difficulties accessing fresh, healthy food due to her neighborhood's condition and her socio-economic status. Additionally, changing dietary habits can be challenging, especially when cultural preferences are involved.

Solve Barrier: Connect her with local food banks or community programs that provide healthy food options. Provide recipes and techniques to make traditional meals healthier. Encourage the use of spices and herbs instead of salt for flavoring. 

Educate: Explain the importance of a heart-healthy diet, the role of different food groups, and the negative impact of sodium and unhealthy fats on her condition. Provide education on reading food labels to make healthier choices when shopping. Emphasize that even small changes in diet can significantly improve heart health.
