Premise: Socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and access to healthcare can significantly impact the management of heart failure in African-American patients. In this context, the patient's exercise regimen becomes a crucial component of overall health management.

Reasoning: Given the socio-economic condition of the patient, access to fitness facilities or hiring a personal trainer might not be feasible. Living in a safe neighborhood provides the opportunity for outdoor physical activities like walking or jogging. As a mid-aged male, he's likely to benefit from moderate aerobic activities, which can improve his heart health. 

Solution: A low-cost, accessible form of exercise like walking or jogging around his neighborhood could be an effective solution. Starting off slow, maybe 15 minutes a day, gradually increasing the duration and intensity as his endurance improves.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may lack motivation or knowledge about how much exercise is beneficial and how to increase exercise levels safely.

Solve Barrier: Providing clear guidelines on how often and how long to exercise, coupled with regular check-ins to encourage and motivate him, could help overcome this barrier. Free or low-cost community exercise programs could also be a resource.

Educate: Explain to the patient the benefits of regular moderate exercise on heart health, including improved blood flow, lower blood pressure, and decreased stress levels. Educate him on the signs of overexertion and when to seek medical help.
