Premise: Socio-economic factors, cultural influences, and healthcare access can significantly impact heart failure management in African-American patients. Given the patient's socio-economic condition, availability and affordability of heart-healthy foods can be a major concern. 

Reasoning: Due to the patient's socio-economic condition, she may not have access to or be able to afford heart-healthy food options. This could impede her ability to manage her heart failure. Moreover, cultural dietary habits might be high in sodium, fats, and sugars, which can exacerbate heart failure conditions. Furthermore, the patient’s age and gender also contribute to her risk level – mid-aged women are more likely to have heart failure compared to younger women.

Solution: Recommend affordable heart-healthy dietary options. Encourage the patient to incorporate foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Suggest ways to make traditional meals healthier by reducing sodium, fat, and sugar content.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient may face difficulties in changing dietary habits due to cultural preferences or lack of knowledge on how to prepare healthier meals. She may also struggle to afford healthier food options.

Solve Barrier: Provide resources on budget-friendly heart-healthy meals. Offer cooking tips and recipes that incorporate heart-healthy foods into traditional dishes. Connect her with local food pantries, community programs or social services that can assist with food affordability.

Educate: Explain to the patient how a heart-healthy diet can help manage her heart failure. Emphasize the importance of reducing sodium, fat, and sugar in her diet and how this can be achieved without completely abandoning her cultural food preferences.
