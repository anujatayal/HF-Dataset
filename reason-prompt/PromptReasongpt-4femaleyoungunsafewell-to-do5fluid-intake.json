Premise: Given the socio-economic status of the patient, access to healthcare and information is likely not a barrier. However, factors like cultural influences and her unsafe neighborhood could impact her ability to manage heart failure, especially with regards to fluid intake.

Reasoning: A well-to-do African-American patient likely has access to healthcare and nutritional food. However, cultural influences may dictate preferences for certain types of food with high salt content which can exacerbate fluid retention in heart failure patients. Her young age plays a role in her ability to change habits and adapt to a new diet. Her unsafe neighborhood might limit her access to physical activities which is important in managing heart failure.

Solution: The patient should aim to reduce salt intake, which can help control fluid volume in her body. This can be achieved by eating more home-cooked meals and reducing the consumption of processed foods.

Anticipate Barrier: The patient's cultural food preferences or habits may be high in salt, and unsafe neighborhood conditions may restrict her from engaging in regular physical activity.

Solve Barrier: Encouraging the patient to explore healthier cooking methods or alternatives that maintain the essence of her traditional foods but with lower salt content. For exercise, recommend indoor exercises or joining a local gym if possible.

Educate: Explain to the patient the importance of reducing salt intake and increasing physical activities in managing heart failure. Discuss the connection between high salt intake, fluid retention, and worsening heart failure symptoms and the benefits of regular exercise for heart health.
