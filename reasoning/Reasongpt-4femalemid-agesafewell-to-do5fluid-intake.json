Patient: I've heard that drinking a lot of water is good for the heart. Is that true?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, but for heart failure patients, too much fluid can strain the heart. So, limit to 1.5-2 liters per day.

Patient: How can I know if I'm drinking too much?

Healthcare Educator: If you experience swelling in your legs or difficulty breathing, you might be drinking too much.

Patient: It's hard for me to drink less. I'm used to drinking a lot.

Healthcare Educator: It's okay, start by gradually reducing your intake. Small changes can make a big difference.

Patient: I'm worried that I'll get dehydrated if I limit my fluid intake.

Healthcare Educator: Don't worry, the recommended amount won't cause dehydration. It's about balance for your heart's health.
