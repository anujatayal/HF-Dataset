Patient: I've heard that I need to limit my fluid-intake. Is that true?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, it's recommended to limit fluid intake to about 2 liters per day for heart failure.

Patient: Why is that necessary?

Healthcare Educator: Limiting fluid intake can help prevent fluid build-up in your body, which can worsen heart failure symptoms.

Patient: What about my morning coffee and tea?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, they also count. All fluids, even soups, are included in your daily fluid intake.

Patient: Do I have to measure everything?

Healthcare Educator: It's a good idea to measure your drinks at first. It helps you understand portion sizes better.

Patient: Isn't it a bit too harsh?

Healthcare Educator: Initially it might seem so, but it's crucial for controlling your heart failure symptoms effectively.

Patient: What happens if I don't limit my fluid intake?

Healthcare Educator: Excess fluid can strain your heart and worsen your heart failure symptoms like shortness of breath.

Patient: What if I feel thirsty?

Healthcare Educator: Try rinsing your mouth with water. You can also suck on a piece of ice or sugarless gum.

Patient: Can I drink more on hot days?

Healthcare Educator: It's best to stick to the limit. If you feel dehydrated, please get in touch with me.

Patient: What about alcohol?

Healthcare Educator: Alcohol should be avoided, as it can weaken the heart muscles and worsen heart failure.
