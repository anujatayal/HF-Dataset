Patient: What foods should I eat for my heart?

Healthcare Educator: Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit processed foods that are high in sodium.

Patient: What are lean proteins?

Healthcare Educator: They are meats with less fat, like chicken, turkey, and fish. Beans and lentils are also good sources.

Patient: Is fried chicken okay?

Healthcare Educator: It's better to bake, grill, or steam your chicken. Fried foods can increase heart disease risk.

Patient: But I love fried foods. Can't I have them sometimes?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, but in moderation. Try to make healthier versions of your favorite fried dishes at home.

Patient: What about salt? I use it a lot in my cooking.

Healthcare Educator: Too much salt can raise your blood pressure. Try using herbs and spices instead to flavor your meals.

Patient: That sounds difficult. I'm used to my cooking style.

Healthcare Educator: It takes time to change. Start small, like reducing salt a little each week.

Patient: And what about drinks? I love my soda.

Healthcare Educator: It's best to limit sugary drinks. Try water, herbal teas or natural fruit juices instead.

Patient: I can't afford all these healthy foods you're suggesting.

Healthcare Educator: You can use food assistance programs or local farmers markets. They often have cheaper fresh produce.

Patient: I've never heard of these programs. How can I find them?

Healthcare Educator: I can refer you to a social worker who can guide you to these resources.

Patient: Thank you. What about my traditional meals? Can I still eat them?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, but try to make them healthier. We can provide nutritional counseling to help you.

Patient: That sounds helpful. I'll try my best.

Healthcare Educator: That's all we can ask. Remember, every small change counts.
