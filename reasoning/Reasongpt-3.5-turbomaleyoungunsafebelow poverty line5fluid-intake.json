[Patient] "I'm struggling with how much fluid to drink. Can you help me?"
[Healthcare Educator] "Try to drink about 8 cups of water a day. Avoid sugary drinks."
[Patient] "What about juices or sports drinks?"
[Healthcare Educator] "Limit those as they can have a lot of added sugar and calories."
[Patient] "I feel thirsty all the time. Should I drink more water?"
[Healthcare Educator] "Listen to your body, but be mindful of fluid overload. Try to spread out your intake."
[Patient] "I can't afford fancy bottled water. What should I do?"
[Healthcare Educator] "Tap water is just as good. You can also use a water filter if needed."
