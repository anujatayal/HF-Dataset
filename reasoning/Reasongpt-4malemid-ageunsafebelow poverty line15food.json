1. [Patient] I've been told to eat healthier for my heart, but I don't know where to start. What should I eat?
2. [Healthcare Educator] Include fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins in your diet. Avoid processed foods high in sodium.
3. [Patient] But it's hard for me to find fresh foods where I live. What can I do?
4. [Healthcare Educator] There are community resources that provide fresh produce at lower costs. I can help you find them.
5. [Patient] That sounds good. But will these foods be too expensive for me?
6. [Healthcare Educator] Many community resources offer affordable or even free fresh produce. It's worth checking out.
7. [Patient] Okay, I'll try that. But what about meat? I like my steak and fried chicken.
8. [Healthcare Educator] It's okay to have meat, but choose lean cuts and try to grill or bake instead of frying.
9. [Patient] Alright, I'll try that. But I love my mom's mac and cheese, and it has a lot of salt. 
10. [Healthcare Educator] Try to limit high-sodium foods. You can use spices or herbs instead of salt for flavor.
11. [Patient] That's a big change for me, but I'll try. How about drinks? I drink a lot of soda.
12. [Healthcare Educator] Try to replace soda with water. If you need flavor, add a slice of fruit or cucumber.
13. [Patient] That sounds refreshing. I'll try it. What about snacks? I usually eat potato chips.
14. [Healthcare Educator] You could switch to unsalted nuts or fruit. They're heart-healthy and still delicious.
15. [Patient] I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the advice. I want my heart to be healthier. 
16. [Healthcare Educator] You're welcome. Remember, every small change helps. Keep going, you're doing great!
