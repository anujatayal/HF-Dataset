Patient: What kind of exercise can I do? I can't go out much.

Healthcare Educator: You can try chair yoga or walking in place at home. Even household chores can keep you active.

Patient: But I don't have much energy.

Healthcare Educator: It's okay to start small. Try 5 minutes at a time and slowly increase as you feel more comfortable.

Patient: Will it really help my heart?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, regular exercise can improve your heart health, help manage your weight, and reduce stress.

Patient: I don't have anyone to exercise with.

Healthcare Educator: That's okay. Maybe you can invite a friend or family member to join you for a walk indoors or chair yoga.
