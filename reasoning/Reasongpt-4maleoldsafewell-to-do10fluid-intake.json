Patient: Doc, what should I drink to keep my heart healthy?

Healthcare Educator: Water is best. Aim for around 2 liters a day. Avoid high-sodium drinks like soda.

Patient: But I like soda. Can I still drink it?

Healthcare Educator: Soda can increase your sodium levels, making your heart work harder. Try to limit it.

Patient: Is there a way to make water taste better?

Healthcare Educator: Yes! You can add fruits like lemons or strawberries to your water for flavor.

Patient: What about coffee? I drink it every morning.

Healthcare Educator: Coffee is okay in moderation, but too much can lead to dehydration. Stick to 1-2 cups a day.

Patient: And alcohol? I enjoy a glass of wine at dinner.

Healthcare Educator: Alcohol can increase blood pressure. Limit it to 1-2 glasses a week.

Patient: I like sweet tea. Is it bad for my heart?

Healthcare Educator: Sweet tea can be high in sugar. Try herbal tea or water infused with fruit instead.

Patient: Is there an easy way to track my fluid intake?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, you can use a daily fluid intake log or a mobile app to help keep track.

Patient: Thank you, Doc. I'll try to limit my soda and alcohol intake.

Healthcare Educator: Great! Remember, small changes can make a big difference for your heart.
