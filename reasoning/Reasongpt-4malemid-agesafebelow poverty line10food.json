Patient: What kind of food should I eat for my heart condition?
Healthcare Educator: Eat more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. These are heart-healthy foods.

Patient: Do I have to give up my favorite foods completely?
Healthcare Educator: Not completely. You can still enjoy them but in moderation and try to pick healthier versions.

Patient: What does "healthier versions" mean?
Healthcare Educator: For example, instead of fried chicken, you can have baked or grilled chicken. It's lower in fat.

Patient: That sounds expensive. I'm not sure I can afford it.
Healthcare Educator: There are local food banks and discount grocery stores where you can get these foods at lower prices.

Patient: But I don't know how to cook these foods in a tasty way.
Healthcare Educator: I can connect you with dietitians who can provide recipes and cooking tips.

Patient: I'm worried I won't like the taste of these healthier foods.
Healthcare Educator: It might take a while to adjust, but these changes can help manage your heart failure.

Patient: How much salt can I use in my cooking?
Healthcare Educator: Try to limit your sodium intake. Use herbs and spices for flavor instead.

Patient: What about fast food? I eat it sometimes when I'm busy.
Healthcare Educator: Fast food can be high in sodium and fat. Try to prepare meals in advance for busy days.

Patient: What if I can't afford these foods even at discount stores?
Healthcare Educator: You might qualify for food assistance programs like SNAP. I can help you apply.

Patient: Will this diet really make a difference in my heart condition?
Healthcare Educator: Yes, a healthy diet can manage your heart failure and improve your quality of life.
