Patient: What kind of food should I eat to help with my heart problem?

Healthcare Educator: Aim for a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and low in sodium and fats.

Patient: But I love fried chicken and collard greens with ham hocks. Can I still eat those?

Healthcare Educator: You can, but in moderation. Try baking your chicken instead and using turkey for the collard greens.

Patient: What about fast food? It's just so convenient!

Healthcare Educator: Fast food often contains high sodium and fats. Cook at home more often, it's healthier and can be fun!

Patient: I don't know how to cook healthy meals. What should I do?

Healthcare Educator: Consider attending a cooking class. It'll help you learn to make heart-healthy meals that are tasty too!
