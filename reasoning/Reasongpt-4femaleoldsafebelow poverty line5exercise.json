Patient: What exercise can I do to help my heart?

Educator: Walking, yoga, or tai chi can be good for your heart and are suitable for your age. 

Patient: I can't afford a gym or classes.

Educator: That's okay. You can do these exercises at home or in your neighborhood without needing a gym.

Patient: But I don't know how to do yoga or tai chi.

Educator: There are free online videos that can guide you. Also, some community centers offer free classes for seniors.

Patient: What if I get tired or the exercise is too hard?

Educator: Start slow and gradually increase. If you feel dizzy, short of breath, or chest pain, stop and rest.

Patient: How often should I exercise?

Educator: Aim for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. But even a few minutes a day can help your heart.
