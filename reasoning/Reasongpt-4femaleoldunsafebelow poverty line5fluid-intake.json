Patient: What should I do about drinking water?

Healthcare Educator: Try to limit your fluid intake to less than 2 liters per day, ma'am.

Patient: But I feel thirsty often. What do I do then?

Healthcare Educator: Sip small amounts of water throughout the day. Don't drink a lot at once.

Patient: Can I drink things other than water?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, but remember all fluids count in your 2 liters, including soup, milk or juice.

Patient: What if I forget and drink more?

Healthcare Educator: If you accidentally drink more, don't worry. Just try to limit it the next day.
