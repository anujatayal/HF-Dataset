Patient: What foods should I eat for my heart?
Healthcare Educator: Eat lots of fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean meats, and fish. Avoid salty and fatty foods.

Patient: But fresh foods are expensive. How can I afford them?
Healthcare Educator: Look for discounted or canned fruits and veggies. Food banks and assistance programs can also help.

Patient: But canned foods have lots of salt, is it okay?
Healthcare Educator: Yes, but rinse canned foods before eating to remove excess salt. For flavor, use spices instead of salt.

Patient: What about fast food? It's cheap and easy.
Healthcare Educator: Fast food can be high in salt and fat. Try to limit it and cook more at home.

Patient: Cooking takes time. Any quick, healthy meal suggestions?
Healthcare Educator: Try a tuna sandwich with whole grain bread. Or, chicken stir-fry with lots of veggies is good too.
