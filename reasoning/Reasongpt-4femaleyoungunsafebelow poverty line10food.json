Patient: What kind of food should I eat?

Healthcare Educator: Eat high-fiber foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Avoid salt and unhealthy fats.

Patient: What about fried chicken? I love it.

Healthcare Educator: Fried foods are not good for heart health. Try baked or grilled chicken instead. It's healthier and tasty too.

Patient: What about greens? We cook them with pork.

Healthcare Educator: Greens are good but avoid pork. Try cooking them with garlic and olive oil instead.

Patient: What if I can't afford these foods?

Healthcare Educator: You can get low-cost fruits, vegetables, and grains at local food banks or farmer's markets. 

Patient: But I don't have a car to get there.

Healthcare Educator: You could try public transportation or carpooling with neighbors. Some markets even have home delivery services.

Patient: Can I eat canned vegetables?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, but rinse them first to remove extra salt. Fresh is best, but canned is better than no vegetables.

Patient: What about salt? I love salty foods. 

Healthcare Educator: Too much salt can strain your heart. Use herbs and spices to add flavor instead. 

Patient: Can I have sodas or sweet drinks?

Healthcare Educator: Avoid sugary drinks. They can lead to weight gain. Try water, unsweetened tea, or fruit-infused water instead.
