Patient: What should I eat for my heart?
 
Educator: Aim for a diet low in salt and fat, and high in fiber. This will help your heart.

Patient: Can you give me some examples?

Educator: Sure! Eat more fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains. 

Patient: But those foods are expensive and not always available nearby. 

Educator: I understand. You can explore programs like SNAP or local food banks for help. 

Patient: What is SNAP?

Educator: SNAP is a food assistance program. It helps people buy healthy food.

Patient: I could try that. But what about salt and fat?

Educator: Avoid processed foods. They often have too much salt and fat. 

Patient: But fast food is cheaper and easier.

Educator: True, but it's not good for your heart. Try to cook more at home. 

Patient: I'm not a good cook.

Educator: Start simple! Even boiling vegetables is a good start.

Patient: How do I know if food is healthy?

Educator: Check food labels. Look for low sodium, low fat, and high fiber. 

Patient: What about exercise?

Educator: Yes, regular exercise is important too. Walking is a good start.

Patient: I'll try. Thanks for the advice. 

Educator: You're welcome! Remember, every small change helps your heart.
