Patient: Do I need to limit my fluid intake because of my heart failure?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, it's best to limit your daily fluid intake to about 2 liters to help manage your condition.

Patient: But I love my sweet tea. Can I still drink that?

Healthcare Educator: You can, but try unsweetened tea or a reduced-sugar version to limit fluid and sugar intake.

Patient: What about alcohol? Can I still have my occasional drink?

Healthcare Educator: Ideally, avoid alcohol as it can worsen heart failure symptoms. If you must, limit it to a minimum.

Patient: Can I drink anything else apart from water?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, non-alcoholic and low-sodium drinks are good. But remember, all liquids count towards your daily limit.

Patient: How do I know if I'm drinking too much?
