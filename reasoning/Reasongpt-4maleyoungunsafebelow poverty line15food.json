Patient: What foods should I be eating for my heart?

Healthcare Educator: Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. These are heart-friendly foods.

Patient: Can I still eat my usual foods?

Patient: Where can I get these heart-friendly foods?

Healthcare Educator: Local food banks, farmers markets, and community gardening programs are good, affordable sources for healthy foods. 

Patient: But what if I can't find these foods in my neighborhood?

Healthcare Educator: Look for programs that deliver fresh produce or accept SNAP benefits. They can help you get healthier foods. 

Patient: How do I know which foods are high in sodium?

Healthcare Educator: Check food labels. Foods with less than 140mg of sodium per serving are considered low-sodium.
