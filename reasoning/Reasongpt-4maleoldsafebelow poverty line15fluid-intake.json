Patient: What should I do about my drinking habits?

Educator: Try to limit your daily fluid intake to about 2 liters, and choose water over sugary drinks.

Patient: Is there a way to measure my intake?

Educator: Yes, you can use a measuring cup or a water bottle with measurements.

Patient: What if I don't have those?

Educator: No worries. One small bottle of water is about 500ml. So, four bottles make about 2 liters.

Patient: Okay, and what about food?

Educator: Try to choose low-sodium foods. Less salt means less fluid retention.

Patient: But those foods are expensive.

Educator: You can use community resources like food banks or government programs to get healthy foods.

Patient: How can I measure salt in my meals?

Educator: It can be a guess. If a meal tastes salty, it probably has too much salt.

Patient: So, no salt at all?

Educator: Not exactly, just less. Try to use herbs and spices for flavor instead.

Patient: Is this really important?

Educator: Yes, it's crucial to prevent fluid overload and worsening of your condition.

Patient: What happens if I don't?

Educator: It can lead to more complications like shortness of breath, swelling, and weight gain.

Patient: Alright, I'll try my best.

Educator: That's great to hear! Small changes can make a big difference.
