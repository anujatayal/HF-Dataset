Patient: What food should I eat for my heart?
 
Healthcare Educator: Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Cut down on salt and unhealthy fats.

Patient: But I love my traditional foods, how can I change that?

Healthcare Educator: You can modify recipes. Use herbs for flavor instead of salt. Choose lean meats instead of fatty ones.

Patient: What if I can't afford this kind of food?

Healthcare Educator: There are local food banks and community resources that provide healthy, low-cost food options. 

Patient: But I find it hard to go there due to my age.

Healthcare Educator: We can connect you with local volunteer groups that can help you with transportation.
