Patient: What kind of food should I eat for my heart?

Healthcare Educator: You should eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. They're good for your heart and affordable too.

Patient: What about fried chicken and pork? I eat them a lot.

Healthcare Educator: It's best to eat less fried foods and pork. They can worsen heart failure due to high fat and sodium.

Patient: But I love my mom's recipes. How can I change them?

Healthcare Educator: You can make healthier versions. For example, bake chicken instead of frying it. 

Patient: Can I eat salt and sugar?

Healthcare Educator: Too much salt and sugar is not good. Try using herbs and spices for flavor instead.

Healthcare Educator: Drink more water and less soda. Soda has a lot of sugar which is not good for your heart.
