Patient: What kind of food should I eat for my heart condition?
 
Healthcare Educator: Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains and limit salty and fatty foods.

Patient: But those foods are expensive and hard to find in my neighborhood.

Healthcare Educator: Have you considered local food banks, community gardens, or assistance programs like WIC or SNAP?

Patient: I don't have transportation to get to those places.

Healthcare Educator: Consider carpooling, using public transportation, or free local shuttle services. Some places offer home delivery too.

Patient: I'm not sure where these resources are.

Healthcare Educator: I can provide a list of local resources and their locations for you to access these foods.
