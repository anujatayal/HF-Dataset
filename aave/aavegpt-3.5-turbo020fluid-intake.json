[Patient] Yo doc, I been feelin' real tired lately. What should I be drinkin' to help with my heart failure?
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there, I hear you. It's important to watch your fluid intake when you have heart failure. You should aim to drink about 6-8 cups of fluid a day. Water is the best choice.
[Patient] Got it, I'll make sure to drink more water. What about soda and juice?
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to limit soda and juice because they can have a lot of sugar and sodium, which can make your heart failure worse. Stick to water as much as possible.
[Patient] Okay, I'll cut back on the soda and juice. What about coffee and tea?
[Healthcare Specialist] Coffee and tea are okay in moderation, but try to limit them to 1-2 cups a day. They can also have caffeine, which can affect your heart.
[Patient] I see, I'll keep that in mind. What about alcohol?
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to avoid alcohol altogether if you have heart failure. It can weaken your heart and make your symptoms worse.
[Patient] Alright, I'll stay away from the alcohol. Thanks for the info, doc.
[Healthcare Specialist] No problem, happy to help. Remember, staying hydrated with water is key for managing your heart failure. Let me know if you have any more questions.
