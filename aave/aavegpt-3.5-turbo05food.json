[Patient] Yo doc, I been tryna eat better to help my heart. What kinda foods should I be eatin'?
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there! It's great that you're looking to improve your diet. You should focus on eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken or fish.
[Patient] Gotcha, so no more fried chicken and mac n' cheese?
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to limit fried foods and dishes high in saturated fats like mac n' cheese. Instead, try baking or grilling your chicken and incorporating more veggies into your meals.
[Patient] I hear you, doc. What about snacks? Can I still have my chips and soda?
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to choose healthier snacks like nuts, fruits, or yogurt instead of chips and soda. These options are lower in sodium and added sugars, which can be better for your heart health.
[Patient] Alright, I'll give those a try. Thanks for the tips, doc.
