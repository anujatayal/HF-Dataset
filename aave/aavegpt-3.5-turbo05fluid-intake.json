[Patient] Yo doc, I been feelin' real tired lately. What should I be drinkin' to help with my heart failure?

[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there, I hear you. It's important to watch your fluid intake when you have heart failure. You should aim to drink about 6-8 cups of fluid a day. Water is the best choice, but you can also have things like herbal tea or low-sugar juices.

[Patient] Got it, I'll make sure to drink more water. But what about soda and sports drinks?

[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to limit soda and sports drinks because they can have a lot of added sugar and sodium, which can make your heart failure worse. Stick to water and other low-sugar options to keep your heart healthy.

[Patient] Okay, I'll stay away from those sugary drinks. What about coffee and tea?

[Healthcare Specialist] Coffee and tea are okay in moderation, but try to limit how much you have each day. Too much caffeine can make your heart work harder, so it's best to stick to just a cup or two a day.

[Patient] Cool, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the info, doc.
