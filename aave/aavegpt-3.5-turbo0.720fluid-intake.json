[Patient] Hey doc, I've been feeling really tired lately. Can you give me some recommendations for how much water I should be drinking? 
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there! It's important for you to stay hydrated, especially with heart failure. You should aim to drink about 8-10 cups of water a day. 
[Patient] 8-10 cups, got it. Should I cut back on other drinks like soda or juice? 
[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, it's best to limit sugary drinks like soda and juice. Water is the best choice for staying hydrated. 
[Patient] Okay, I'll try to stick to water then. What about foods that can help with hydration? 
[Healthcare Specialist] Foods with high water content like fruits and vegetables can also help keep you hydrated. Think about adding more watermelon, cucumbers, and celery to your diet. 
[Patient] Watermelon, cucumbers, and celery, got it. Are there any signs I should watch out for that I'm not drinking enough water? 
[Healthcare Specialist] If you start feeling thirsty, have dark yellow urine, or feel dizzy or lightheaded, those could be signs that you need to drink more water. 
[Patient] Dark yellow urine, got it. Thanks for the tips, doc. I'll make sure to keep up with my fluid intake. 
[Healthcare Specialist] You're welcome! Remember, staying hydrated is key for managing your heart failure. Let me know if you have any other questions. 
[Patient] Will do, thanks again for all your help, doc.
