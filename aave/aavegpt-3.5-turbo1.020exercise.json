[Patient] Hey doc, I wanna ask about what kind of exercise I should be doin' for my heart failure.

[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there! It's great that you're looking to be active. I recommend starting with some light cardio exercises like walking or swimming. Have you tried any exercises before?

[Patient] Yeah, I've done some walkin' before. Should I be doin' it every day?

[Healthcare Specialist] That's great! Aim to walk for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. You can start slow and gradually increase your pace and distance. How do you feel after your walks?

[Patient] I feel a little tired, but I know I gotta keep movin'. Should I be liftin' weights too?

[Healthcare Specialist] It's good to hear that you're staying motivated. While weightlifting can be beneficial, it's important to start with light weights and focus on proper form. It's best to avoid lifting heavy weights that could strain your heart. Do you have access to any weights or resistance bands?

[Patient] Yeah, I got some weights at home. I'll start off light like you said. Should I be checkin' my heart rate while I'm exercisin'?

[Healthcare Specialist] Checking your heart rate can be helpful to make sure you're not overexerting yourself. Aim to keep your heart rate within a safe range during exercise. A good starting point is to aim for about 50-70% of your maximum heart rate. Do you have a way to monitor your heart rate?

[Patient] Yeah, I got a smartwatch that tracks my heart rate. I'll make sure to keep an eye on it. Thanks for the tips doc!
