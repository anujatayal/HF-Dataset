[Patient] Yo doc, I know water is important, but how much should I be drinkin' with my heart failure?
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there, it's important to keep track of your fluid intake. You should aim for about 8 cups of fluid per day. This includes water, juice, and other beverages.
[Patient] Okay, got it. Should I be drinkin' all that water at once or spread out throughout the day?
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to spread it out throughout the day. Try to drink a glass of water with each meal and snack to help keep your body hydrated.
[Patient] Cool, I'll make sure to do that. What about salt, should I be watchin' how much I'm eatin'?
[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, it's important to watch your salt intake with heart failure. Try to limit processed foods and use herbs and spices to flavor your meals instead of salt.
[Patient] Gotcha, I'll try to cut back on the salt. Anything else I should know about stayin' hydrated with heart failure?
[Healthcare Specialist] One more thing to keep in mind is to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can dehydrate your body. Stick to water and other hydrating beverages to keep your body functioning properly.
