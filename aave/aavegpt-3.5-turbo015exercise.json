[Patient] Yo doc, I been feelin' tired lately. What kind of exercise can I do to help with my heart failure?
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there, I hear you. It's important to stay active, but not overdo it. How about starting with some light walking or swimming?
[Patient] Yeah, I can do that. How often should I be exercising?
[Healthcare Specialist] Aim for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. But listen to your body and take breaks when needed.
[Patient] Got it. Should I be lifting weights or doing cardio?
[Healthcare Specialist] Both are good, but start with cardio to improve your heart health. You can add in some light weights later on.
[Patient] Cool, I'll start with walking then. Any other tips for exercising with heart failure?
[Healthcare Specialist] Make sure to stay hydrated, wear comfortable shoes, and listen to your body. And don't forget to warm up and cool down before and after exercising.
[Patient] Thanks for the tips, doc. I'll make sure to take it easy and stay active.
