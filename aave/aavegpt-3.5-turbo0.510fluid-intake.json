[Patient] "Hey doc, I've been feeling really tired lately. Can you give me some tips on how much water I should be drinking with my heart failure?"
[Specialist] "Hey there! It's important for you to stay hydrated, but you should also be careful not to drink too much water. I recommend aiming for about 6-8 cups of water a day. How much water do you usually drink?"
[Patient] "I try to drink a lot of water because I know it's good for me. But sometimes I feel like I'm drinking too much. How can I tell if I'm drinking too much water?"
[Specialist] "That's great that you're trying to stay hydrated! Signs of drinking too much water include feeling bloated, having to pee a lot, and swelling in your legs. Have you noticed any of these symptoms?"
[Patient] "Yeah, I've been feeling bloated and my legs have been swelling up. What should I do to help with that?"
[Specialist] "If you're experiencing those symptoms, it's important to cut back on your fluid intake. Try to limit your water intake to around 6 cups a day and see if that helps. Also, make sure to avoid salty foods that can make you retain water. How does that sound to you?"
[Patient] "That sounds good, I'll try to cut back on my water intake and watch what I eat. Thanks for the advice, doc!"
[Specialist] "You're welcome! Remember, it's all about finding the right balance for your body. If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Take care of yourself!" 
[Patient] "I appreciate the help, doc. I'll make sure to keep you updated on how I'm doing. Thanks again!"
[Specialist] "No problem at all! I'm here to help you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Take care and stay healthy!"
