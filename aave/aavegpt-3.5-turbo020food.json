[Patient] Yo doc, what kinda food should I be eatin' to help with my heart failure?
[Healthcare Specialist] Well, it's important to focus on a heart-healthy diet. That means eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken and fish.
[Patient] So, like, what about soul food? Can I still eat that?
[Healthcare Specialist] You can still enjoy soul food, but try to make healthier versions. Instead of fried chicken, try baking or grilling it. And use less salt and butter in your cooking.
[Patient] Got it, I can make some swaps. What about snacks?
[Healthcare Specialist] For snacks, try to choose things like nuts, fruits, or yogurt instead of chips or candy. And watch out for hidden salt in packaged foods.
[Patient] Cool, I can do that. What about drinks?
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to stick to water, unsweetened tea, or low-fat milk. Avoid sugary drinks like soda and limit your intake of alcohol.
[Patient] Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tips, doc.
