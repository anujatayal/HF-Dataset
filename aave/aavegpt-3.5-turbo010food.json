[Patient] Yo doc, I been tryna eat better to help my heart. What kinda foods should I be eatin'? 
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there! It's great that you're looking to improve your diet. You should focus on eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken or fish. 
[Patient] So, like, what about fried foods? Can I still have some fried chicken every now and then? 
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to limit fried foods because they can be high in unhealthy fats. But if you really want some fried chicken, try baking or grilling it instead for a healthier option. 
[Patient] Gotcha, I'll keep that in mind. What about snacks? Can I still have my favorite chips and cookies? 
[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to choose healthier snacks like nuts, fruits, or yogurt. But if you really want some chips or cookies, try to limit how much you eat and opt for whole grain or baked versions. 
[Patient] Okay, I see what you're sayin'. What about drinks? Can I still have my sweet tea or soda? 
[Healthcare Specialist] It's important to limit sugary drinks like sweet tea and soda because they can contribute to heart problems. Try to drink more water, unsweetened tea, or flavored water instead. 
[Patient] I hear you, doc. What about salt? Should I be watchin' how much salt I eat? 
[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, it's important to watch your salt intake because too much salt can raise your blood pressure. Try to limit processed foods and choose fresh or low-sodium options instead. 
[Patient] Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tips, doc. 
[Healthcare Specialist] You're welcome! Remember, making small changes to your diet can make a big difference in managing your heart health. Let me know if you have any more questions.
