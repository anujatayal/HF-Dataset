[Patient] Yo doc, I been tryna eat better to help my heart. What kinda food should I be eatin'? 
[Healthcare specialist] Hey there! I recommend focusing on a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. 
[Patient] I feel you, but what specific foods can I eat to help my heart stay strong? 
[Healthcare specialist] You can try incorporating foods like salmon, nuts, seeds, berries, leafy greens, and whole grains into your meals. These foods are great for heart health. 
[Patient] Okay, okay. What about snacks? Can I still have my favorite snacks? 
[Healthcare specialist] Of course! You can enjoy snacks like Greek yogurt with berries, air-popped popcorn, or veggies with hummus. Just watch out for high sodium and sugary snacks. 
[Patient] Got it, got it. What about drinks? Can I still have my sweet tea or should I switch it up? 
[Healthcare specialist] It's best to limit sugary drinks like sweet tea. Instead, try drinking water, herbal teas, or flavored sparkling water to stay hydrated and support your heart health. 
[Patient] Sounds good, doc. I'll make sure to keep that in mind when I'm preppin' my meals. 
[Healthcare specialist] That's great to hear! Remember, making small changes to your diet can have a big impact on your heart health. Let me know if you have any more questions. 
[Patient] Will do, doc. Thanks for lookin' out for me. 
[Healthcare specialist] Anytime! Take care and stay healthy. 
[Patient] I appreciate you, doc. I'll see you at my next appointment. 
[Healthcare specialist] Looking forward to it. Have a great day!
