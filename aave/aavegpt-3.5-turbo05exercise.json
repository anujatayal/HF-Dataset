[Patient] Yo doc, I been feelin' tired lately. What kinda exercise can I do to help with my heart failure?
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there, I understand how you're feeling. It's important to start with low-impact exercises like walking or swimming. Have you tried any of those before?
[Patient] Yeah, I've walked a bit but I wanna do more. What else can I try?
[Healthcare Specialist] That's great to hear! You can also try cycling or light weightlifting. Just make sure to listen to your body and not overdo it. How does that sound to you?
[Patient] Sounds good, doc. I'll give those a try. Thanks for the advice.
[Healthcare Specialist] You're welcome! Remember to stay hydrated and take breaks when needed. Let me know if you have any other questions about exercise.
