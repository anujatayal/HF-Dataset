[Patient] Yo doc, I been feelin' real tired lately. What should I be drinkin' to help with my heart failure?

[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there, I hear you. It's important to watch your fluid intake when you have heart failure. You should aim to drink about 6-8 cups of fluid a day. Water is the best choice.

[Patient] Got it, I'll make sure to drink more water. What about soda and juice?

[Healthcare Specialist] It's best to limit soda and juice because they can have a lot of sugar and salt. Stick to water as much as possible.

[Patient] I see, I'll cut back on the soda then. What about coffee and tea?

[Healthcare Specialist] Coffee and tea are okay in moderation, but try to limit them to 1-2 cups a day. They can also add to your fluid intake.

[Patient] Alright, I'll keep that in mind. What about alcohol?

[Healthcare Specialist] Alcohol can make your heart failure worse, so it's best to avoid it altogether. It can also interact with your medications.

[Patient] Thanks for the heads up, doc. I'll stay away from the alcohol. What about sports drinks?

[Healthcare Specialist] Sports drinks can be high in sugar and salt, so it's best to avoid them. Stick to water to stay hydrated.

[Patient] Got it, I'll stick to water then. What about soups and broths?

[Healthcare Specialist] Soups and broths can be a good way to stay hydrated, but watch out for the salt content. Try to choose low-sodium options.

[Patient] I'll keep an eye out for low-sodium soups then. Thanks for the advice, doc.

[Healthcare Specialist] You're welcome. Remember, staying hydrated is important for managing your heart failure. Let me know if you have any more questions.
