This means limiting fast foods, processed foods like canned soups or frozen dinners, fatty meat, fried foods, butter, and sweets. Also, it's wise to cut down on drinks like soda or energy drinks that are high in sugar. Do you find it challenging to make these changes?

Oatmeal with fresh fruits can serve as a healthy breakfast. Try experimenting with spices and herbs for flavor instead of using salt. Remember, it's good to make changes gradually and not all at once. Take small steps towards healthier eating. Do you think these ideas will work for you?
