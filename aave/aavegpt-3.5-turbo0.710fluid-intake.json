Healthcare Specialist: Good morning! How can I help you today?

Patient: Hey doc, I've been feeling really tired lately and I think it might be my heart acting up.

Healthcare Specialist: I'm sorry to hear that. It's important to stay on top of your heart health. Have you been monitoring your fluid intake?

Patient: Yeah, I've been trying to drink more water, but I'm not sure how much is enough.

Healthcare Specialist: It's great that you're staying hydrated. For heart failure patients, it's important to limit fluid intake to about 2 liters or 8 cups a day. This can help reduce strain on your heart.

Patient: Alright, I'll try to keep track of how much I'm drinking. Any other recommendations for fluid intake?

Healthcare Specialist: Along with water, you can also include other fluids like herbal teas, low-sugar juices, and broths in your daily intake. Just make sure to avoid drinks with high sugar or caffeine content.

Patient: Got it, I'll stick to the good stuff. Thanks for the advice, doc.

Healthcare Specialist: You're welcome! Remember, staying mindful of your fluid intake can make a big difference in managing your heart health. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
