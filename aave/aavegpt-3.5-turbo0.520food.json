[Patient] Hey doc, I've been trying to eat better to help my heart. What kind of foods should I be focusing on?
[Healthcare Specialist] Hey there! That's great that you're thinking about your heart health. You should try to focus on eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken or fish.
[Patient] Got it, I'll start adding more of those to my meals. What about snacks? Any recommendations for heart-healthy snacks?
[Healthcare Specialist] For snacks, you can try things like nuts, seeds, or Greek yogurt. These are all good options that can help keep your heart healthy.
[Patient] Sounds good, I'll definitely stock up on those. How about drinks? What should I be drinking to help my heart?
[Healthcare Specialist] It's important to stay hydrated, so make sure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day. You can also try drinking green tea or herbal teas for some added heart-healthy benefits.
[Patient] I'll make sure to drink more water and try out those teas. Thanks for the tips, doc!
