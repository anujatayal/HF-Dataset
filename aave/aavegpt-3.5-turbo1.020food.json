[Patient] Yo doc, I gotta ask you somethin'. What kinda food you recommend for someone with heart failure like me?
[Healthcare specialist] Well, I recommend focusing on eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. They're good for your heart and overall health.
[Patient] Got it, so I need to eat more greens and stuff like that?
[Healthcare specialist] Exactly, foods like spinach, broccoli, and kale are great choices. They're low in calories and high in vitamins and minerals.
[Patient] What about protein? Can I still eat meat?
[Healthcare specialist] You can definitely still eat meat, but try to choose lean options like chicken or fish instead of fatty cuts of beef or pork.
[Patient] Cool, I can do that. What about carbs though?
[Healthcare specialist] It's important to choose whole grains over refined grains. So opt for whole wheat bread, brown rice, and quinoa instead of white bread and white rice.
[Patient] Thanks for the tips, doc. What about snacks? Any recommendations there?
[Healthcare specialist] For snacks, try to pick healthier options like nuts, seeds, or fresh fruit instead of chips or cookies. They're lower in unhealthy fats and sugars.
[Patient] That makes sense. What about drinks? Can I still have my sweet tea?
[Healthcare specialist] It's best to limit sugary drinks like sweet tea. Water is always the best choice for staying hydrated and supporting heart health.
[Patient] Got it, I'll try to drink more water. Thanks for the advice, doc.
