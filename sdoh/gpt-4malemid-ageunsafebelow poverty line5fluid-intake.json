Patient: How much water should I be drinking with my heart condition?

Healthcare Educator: Aim for around 6 to 8 cups a day, but remember, don't drink all at once.

Patient: Is it okay if I drink more than that?

Healthcare Educator: Drinking more can make your heart work harder, so it's best to stick to the recommended amount.

Patient: What if I get thirsty?

Healthcare Educator: Small sips, ice chips, or chewing gum can help manage thirst without drinking too much.

Patient: What about other fluids like juice or soda?

Healthcare Educator: Those are okay occasionally, but water is best. And avoid alcohol and caffeine. They can make heart failure worse.
