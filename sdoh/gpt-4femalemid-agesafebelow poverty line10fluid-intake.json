Patient: What should I know about fluid-intake for my heart condition?
Healthcare Educator: It's important to limit fluids to prevent overworking your heart. Aim for less than 2 liters per day.

Patient: 2 liters, huh? How do I measure that?
Healthcare Educator: That's about 8.5 cups. You can use a measuring cup or marked water bottle to track it.

Patient: Can I drink anything I want within that limit?
Healthcare Educator: Mostly water is best. Avoid drinks with alcohol or caffeine as they can dehydrate you.

Patient: What about my favorite soda?
Healthcare Educator: Soda can have a lot of sodium which can worsen heart failure. Try to limit or avoid it.

Patient: How about when I'm thirsty?
Healthcare Educator: Try small sips, ice chips, or sugar-free gum. It can help you feel less thirsty.

Patient: Can I drink more if I exercise?
Healthcare Educator: Yes, but not too much. Drink enough to replace the fluids lost during exercise.

Patient: What if I accidentally drink more than 2 liters?
Healthcare Educator: Don't worry, but try to be mindful the next day. Balance is key to keep your heart healthy.

Patient: How will I know if I'm drinking too much?
Healthcare Educator: Rapid weight gain can be a sign. Weigh yourself daily and call if you gain more than 2 pounds.

Patient: Okay, I understand now. Thanks for your help.
Healthcare Educator: You're welcome! Remember, moderation is key. Keep track of your fluid intake for a healthy heart.
