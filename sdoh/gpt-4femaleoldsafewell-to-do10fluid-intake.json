Patient: What should be my daily fluid intake?

Healthcare Educator: Aim for 6 to 8 cups of fluid a day, but not more.

Patient: What do you mean by fluid? Just water or something else too?

Healthcare Educator: By fluid, I mean water, juice, milk, and even soups. But avoid drinks high in sodium or sugar.
