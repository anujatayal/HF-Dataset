Patient: I'd like to start exercising. What do you suggest for me?
Healthcare Educator: That's great! Gentle cardio like walking or swimming are ideal. Do you have a pool nearby?

Patient: No, my neighborhood isn't safe for outdoor activities. What can I do at home?
Healthcare Educator: You can try indoor activities like yoga, light stretching, or using a stationary bike.

Patient: What about lifting weights? Is it safe for my heart?
Healthcare Educator: Light weights are fine, but avoid heavy lifting. It may strain your heart.

Patient: How long should I exercise each day?
Healthcare Educator: Start with 15 minutes a day, then gradually increase to 30 minutes as you feel comfortable.

Patient: How will I know if I'm overdoing it?
Healthcare Educator: If you feel lightheaded, out of breath, or have chest pain, take a break. Listen to your body.
