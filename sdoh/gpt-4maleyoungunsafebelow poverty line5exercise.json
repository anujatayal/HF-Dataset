Patient: What kind of exercise can I do for my heart?

Healthcare Educator: Walking is a great exercise. Start slow, perhaps 10 minutes a day, then gradually increase time.

Patient: My neighborhood isn't safe. Where else can I walk?

Healthcare Educator: Indoor exercises are also good. You can walk in place at home or climb up and down stairs.

Patient: I live in a small apartment, not much space. Any other suggestions?

Healthcare Educator: Chair exercises can be done in small spaces. Try leg lifts and arm raises while seated.

Patient: I'm not strong enough for long exercises. What should I do?

Healthcare Educator: It's okay. Start with short sessions, like 5 minutes. Gradually increase as you feel stronger.

Patient: What if I feel pain or discomfort during exercise?

Healthcare Educator: If you feel pain, stop immediately. Rest and see if it subsides. If not, seek medical attention.
