Patient: What type of food should I be eating to help manage my heart failure?

Healthcare Educator: You should focus on a heart-healthy diet. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

Patient: Does that mean I can't eat any fried food?

Healthcare Educator: It's best to limit fried foods. They can increase your cholesterol and blood pressure levels.

Patient: How about salt? I add it to most of my meals.

Healthcare Educator: Try to cut back on salt. Too much can make your body hold onto water and worsen your heart failure.

Patient: Can I still enjoy my favorite sweet treats?

Healthcare Educator: Yes, but in moderation. Too much sugar can lead to weight gain, which can put pressure on your heart.

Patient: What about alcohol? I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner.

Healthcare Educator: It's okay to have a small glass, but limit alcohol. Too much can weaken your heart muscles over time.
