Patient: How much water should I be drinking each day?
Healthcare Educator: Aim for around 6 to 9 cups each day, but it can vary based on your symptoms.

Patient: What happens if I drink too much?
Healthcare Educator: Too much fluid can make your heart work harder. Symptoms include shortness of breath and swelling.

Patient: What about when it's really hot outside?
Healthcare Educator: You may need a bit more. But if you feel breathless or notice swelling, cut back a little.

Patient: Can I drink other fluids apart from water?
Healthcare Educator: Yes, but avoid drinks with caffeine or alcohol. They can dehydrate you and make symptoms worse.
