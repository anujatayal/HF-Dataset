Healthcare Educator: It's best to limit your fluid intake to about 1.5 to 2 liters per day.

Patient: What does 2 liters look like? I don't understand.
Healthcare Educator: That's about 8 cups. Imagine four 500ml soda bottles, that's 2 liters.

Patient: Is tea or coffee okay to drink?
Healthcare Educator: Yes, but they count towards your daily limit. Also, limit caffeinated drinks as they can increase heart rate.

Patient: What about alcohol? I enjoy a drink sometimes.
Healthcare Educator: It's best to avoid alcohol. It can cause dehydration and make your heart work harder.

Patient: What happens if I drink too much fluid?
Healthcare Educator: Your heart has to work harder to pump the extra fluid, which could worsen your heart condition.
