Patient: What kind of exercises can I do with my heart condition?
Educator: Walking is a good start. Start slow, maybe 10 minutes daily, and increase as you feel comfortable.

Patient: What about weightlifting? I used to enjoy it.
Educator: Light weights are okay. But avoid heavy weights as they can strain your heart.

Patient: My neighborhood isn't very safe for walking. Any suggestions?
Educator: You can walk at a local mall or invest in a treadmill for home use.

Patient: Is there any exercise I should avoid?
Educator: Yes, avoid strenuous activities like running or high-intensity workouts. They can overwork your heart.

Patient: How will I know if I'm overdoing it?
Educator: If you feel dizzy, breathless, or have chest pain, stop immediately. It means you're pushing too hard.
