Patient: I want to exercise, but I'm not sure what's safe for my heart. Any suggestions?
Healthcare Educator: Absolutely! Walking is a great option. It's low-impact and helps strengthen your heart.

Patient: But, my neighborhood is not safe for walking, what can I do?
Healthcare Educator: I understand. What about a stationary bike or a treadmill at home? 

Patient: I can't afford to buy exercise equipment. Is there anything else I can do?
Healthcare Educator: Sure! You can do chair exercises or household chores which can also help to keep you active.

Patient: Okay. How long should I exercise each day?
Healthcare Educator: Start with 10 minutes a day, then slowly increase as you feel comfortable.

Patient: What if I feel tired or out of breath?
Healthcare Educator: That's your body's way of saying take it easy. Rest, then try again when you're ready.
