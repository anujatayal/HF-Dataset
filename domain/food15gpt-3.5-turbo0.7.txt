They are low in sodium and high in nutrients that are beneficial for your heart. Also, choosing whole grains like brown rice and whole wheat bread over refined grains can be beneficial. Do you have any other questions?

Patient: I've heard that fish is good for the heart. Is that true?

Healthcare Specialist: Yes, that's correct! Fish, especially fatty fish like salmon and sardines, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which have been shown to have heart-protective benefits.
