Patient: Hi, I have been experiencing trouble sleeping lately. Can you tell me if it's related to my heart failure?

It also allows your body to repair itself and regulate hormones that affect your heart. Getting enough sleep can improve your overall heart health and quality of life.

Patient: What can I do to improve my sleep quality?
Specialist: There are several things you can try. Establishing a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and large meals before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help. It's also important to sleep in a comfortable and cool environment. If these strategies don't work, we can discuss other options to improve your sleep quality.
