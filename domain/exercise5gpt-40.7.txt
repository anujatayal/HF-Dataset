[Patient] I was diagnosed with heart failure recently. Can I still exercise?

[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, you absolutely can and should still exercise. In fact, regular physical activity can help strengthen your heart muscle, improve your energy levels and make you feel better overall. It's important to remember that exercise should be adjusted to your individual abilities and needs.

[Patient] What type of exercise should I be doing?

[Healthcare Specialist] A well-rounded exercise program includes aerobic exercises like walking, cycling, or swimming, as well as strength training for muscle strength. It's also beneficial to include flexibility and balance exercises. But remember to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and duration.

[Patient] Are there any precautions I need to take?

[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, before starting any exercise program, it's important to consult with your heart doctor or a physical therapist who can tailor an exercise plan based on your condition. Always listen to your body and don't push too hard. If you experience any discomfort or unusual symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue, you should stop exercising and contact your healthcare team.

[Healthcare Specialist] How about we start you on a light exercise program and gradually increase its intensity as your body becomes more accustomed to it?
