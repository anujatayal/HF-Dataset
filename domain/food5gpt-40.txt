[Patient] What kind of food should I be eating now that I have heart failure?

[Healthcare Specialist] It's important to eat a balanced diet that's low in salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol. This includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins like fish and poultry, and low-fat or non-fat dairy products. 

[Patient] Can I still eat my favorite foods?

[Healthcare Specialist] You can still enjoy your favorite foods, but you might need to make some modifications. For example, if you love fried chicken, you could try baking or grilling it instead to reduce the fat content. 

[Patient] What about salt? I heard it's bad for heart failure.

[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, that's correct. Too much salt can cause your body to retain water, which can make your heart work harder. Try to limit your salt intake and use herbs and spices for flavor instead.

[Patient] I love my morning coffee. Should I stop drinking it?

[Healthcare Specialist] You don't necessarily have to give up coffee, but moderation is key. Too much caffeine can increase your heart rate. Try to limit yourself to one or two cups a day.
