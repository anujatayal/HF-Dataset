Establishing a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and heavy meals before bed, and creating a comfortable sleep environment can all contribute to better sleep. It's also important to manage any stress or anxiety that may be keeping you awake.
Patient: That makes sense. How many hours of sleep should I aim for each night?
Healthcare Specialist: Most adults need about 7-9 hours of sleep each night. However, it's important to listen to your body and give it the rest it needs. If you feel tired during the day, it may be a sign that you need more sleep.

Healthcare Specialist: Yes, sleep apnea can have a significant impact on heart failure. It's a condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. It's important to get tested for sleep apnea if you experience symptoms like loud snoring, daytime sleepiness, or morning headaches. Proper treatment of sleep apnea can help improve heart function.
