[Patient] I love my soul food, but I've been hearing it's not so good for my heart condition. Is that true?

[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, you're right. Certain types of food, especially those high in salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol, can worsen your heart condition. Soul food often has these ingredients, which can increase blood pressure and cholesterol levels, putting more strain on your heart.

[Patient] So, does this mean I have to give up my favorite foods completely?

[Healthcare Specialist] Not necessarily, it's more about balance and moderation. You can still enjoy your favorite foods, but try to limit the portions and frequency. Also, consider healthier ways of preparing them, for example, using less salt and more herbs and spices for flavor.

[Patient] What should I focus on eating then?

[Healthcare Specialist] Try to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your diet. These foods can help manage your heart condition by keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in check. Remember, food is not just about enjoyment, it's also a critical tool in managing your heart health.
