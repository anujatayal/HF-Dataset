[Patient] Doctor, I'm a bit confused about what I should be eating now that I've been diagnosed with heart failure. Can you help me understand better?

[Healthcare Specialist] Of course! I can certainly help with that. Eating a balanced diet is very important for your heart health. You should aim to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. These foods are high in nutrients and low in fats and sugars, which is beneficial for your heart.

[Patient] I love fried chicken and barbeque, but I guess I need to cut down on those?

[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, you're correct. Fried foods and barbeque often contain high amounts of saturated and trans fats, which can increase your cholesterol levels and risk of heart disease. Instead, try grilling or baking your chicken and use spices and herbs for flavor.

[Patient] What about salt? I heard it's not good for heart failure patients.

[Healthcare Specialist] That's correct. High sodium intake can make your body retain more water, which can put an extra burden on your heart. It's recommended to limit your sodium intake to less than 2,000 milligrams a day.

[Patient] I see. Are there any specific foods that can help improve my heart health?

[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like fish, can help improve heart health. Also, foods high in fiber, such as oats, lentils, and beans, can help lower your cholesterol levels. Fruits and vegetables are also great for your heart due to their high antioxidant content.

[Patient] Thank you, doctor. I will try to incorporate these changes into my diet.

[Healthcare Specialist] That's great! Remember, making these changes can significantly improve your heart health and overall well-being. It's not about depriving yourself, but about making healthier choices.
