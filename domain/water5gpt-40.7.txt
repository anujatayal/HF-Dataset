[Patient] I have heart failure and I hear a lot about water intake. How important is it really?

[Healthcare Specialist] It's very important. Water is essential for our body to function properly. However, when it comes to heart failure, we need to find a balance. Too much water can put an additional strain on your heart as it needs to work harder to pump the extra fluid around your body.

[Patient] Okay, I understand. But what happens if I drink too little water? 

[Healthcare Specialist] Drinking too little water can lead to dehydration, which in turn can make your heart work harder and cause your blood pressure to rise. It's all about finding the right balance. Your body needs enough fluids to function properly but not so much that it overworks your heart.

[Patient] How do I find this balance? 

[Healthcare Specialist] You should aim for around 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, but this may vary depending on your specific condition and body needs. It's best to monitor your weight daily. If you gain more than 2 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week, it could be a sign that you're retaining fluid and should reduce your fluid intake. Also, limit your salt intake as it makes you thirsty and can lead to fluid retention.
