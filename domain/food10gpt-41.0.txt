[Patient] What kind of food should I be eating since I have heart failure? 

[Healthcare Specialist] Great question! It's important to consume a heart-healthy diet. That means lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like poultry, fish, and beans. It's also beneficial to minimize sodium (salt) intake as it can lead to fluid retention which is not good for an overworked heart. 

[Patient] But I love salt! It makes the food taste so much better. How much can I have?

[Healthcare Specialist] I understand your love for salt. However, it's recommended to limit sodium to about 1500 milligrams per day for heart failure patients. You can explore using other herbs and spices to flavor your food. 

[Patient] I heard that I need to be wary of fluid intake too, is that right?

[Healthcare Specialist] Yes, that's correct. Consuming too much fluid can make your heart work harder. Try to keep your fluid intake to about 2 liters per day, including all drinks and soups.

[Patient] What about alcohol and caffeine, Doctor?

[Healthcare Specialist] Both alcohol and caffeine can interfere with your medications and make your heart work harder. It's generally a good idea to limit or eliminate these from your diet.

[Patient] Are there any specific fruits or vegetables that I should eat?

[Healthcare Specialist] All fruits and vegetables are good for you, as they are low in fat and high in fiber. However, avocados, bananas, oranges, and tomatoes are especially beneficial due to their high potassium content, which helps balance the amount of sodium in your body.

[Patient] Okay, I will keep these tips in mind. Thanks, Doctor.

[Healthcare Specialist] You're welcome! Remember, managing your diet is a key component in managing your heart health. Healthy eating habits can significantly improve your overall wellbeing.
